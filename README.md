React UseAnimations Icons

This package gives you the full functionality and customization of UseAnimations' Icon right out of the box.

You can customize the following properties:

`iconName`: Name of the icon to show (taken from [React UseAnimations](https://react.useanimations.com/))
`color`: Color of the icon
`speed`: Speed of the animation
`reverse`: Whether the animation should reverse
`autoplay`: Whether the animation should play automatically
`loop`: Whether the animation should loop

Some properties don't work together, consult the [React UseAnimations Docs](https://react.useanimations.com/) or their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/useAnimations) for more information.

Feel free to make a PR to [this repository](https://github.com/addisonschultz/UseAnimations) to add any additional icons that might have been missed or have come out after the initial release of this package.

You can also tweet me at [@addisonschultz](https://twitter.com/AddisonSchultz) for any questions!
